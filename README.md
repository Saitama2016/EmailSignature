# Shine Solar Email Signature Creator
Email signatures are often an afterthought (if a thought at all) when you become a new employee at *any* place of work, but they are something (if done well) that you see and think "wow, that's something that I want for myself!". The problem is, these signatures are created with [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and are not easily edited by a user who may not know technology very well. This little tool fixes that problem. Using [Progressive Web App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications) technology, we have brought you this app. With the company template designed by our Director of Design, [Nic Moseley](https://nicmoseley.com/) (reachable at nmoseley@shinesolar.com) and the backend logic developed by our Lead Developer, Adam McGurk (reachable at amcgurk@shinesolar.com) this tool allows everyone in the Shine Solar to generate a usuable copy and paste email signature with no need to touch any code at all!

## Getting Started
If you want to see the video tutorial of how to do it - [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJQydApwHE) 

If you want to know how to get it going on your live machine, clone or fork the repo, and drop it into any Apache or NGINX distro that packages fast-cgi PHP or something similar. That's it. It should be pretty plug and play.

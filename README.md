# Shine Solar Email Signature Creator
Email signatures are often an afterthought (if a thought at all) when you become a new employee at *any* place of work, but they are something (if done well) that you see and think "wow, that's something that I want for myself!". The problem is, these signatures are created with [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML,"Wikipedia entry for HTML") and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets,"Wikipedia entry for CSS") and are not easily edited by user who may not know technology very well. This little tool fixes that problem. With the company template designed by our Director of Design, [Nic Moseley](https://nicmoseley.com/) (reachable at nmoseley@shinesolar.com) and the backend logic developed by our Lead Developer, Adam McGurk (reachable at amcgurk@shinesolar.com) this tool allows everyone in the Shine Solar to generate a usuable copy and paste email signature with no need to touch any code at all!

## Getting Started
If you want to see the video tutorial of how to do it - [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wJQydApwHE) 

If you want to know how to get it going on your live machine, clone or fork the repo, and drop it into any Apache or NGINX distro that packages fast-cgi PHP or something similar. That's it. It should be pretty plug and play.
